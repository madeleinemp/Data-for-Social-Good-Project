Unit 3: Arrays and Algorithms

User Story: “As a baker, I want to analyze a pastry data set so I can find the most 
   popular pastry, how expensive it is, and how much was bought of said pastry.”


Description: This program analyzes a data set from a French Bakery which includes the different pastry names/types, and the amount and price of each pastry! By traversing the data set using 1D arrays and loops, bakers can take their sales records and find their most popular pastry sold which is based on the total amount sold in a given period of time.
